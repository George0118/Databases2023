Title: LibAPP (Library Management System)

Description:
LibAPP (Library Management System) is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline and automate the operations of a library. It provides a user-friendly interface for school administrators, users, and general administrators, offering a range of functionalities to efficiently manage book borrowings, user accounts, reservations, and more.

Key Features:

1. User Management: School administrators have the authority to create and approve user accounts. They can also delete or suspend accounts as necessary, ensuring a secure and controlled library environment.

2. Book Management: School administrators can manage the library's collection, including adding new books, updating book information, and marking books as available or unavailable. The system enables efficient organization and tracking of books across multiple schools.

3. Borrowing and Reservation: Users can reserve books, view their past borrowings, and check the availability of books. The system automates the borrowing process, reducing manual efforts and providing a seamless experience for users.

4. Reviews and Recommendations: Users can review the books they have read, sharing their opinions and feedback with others. This feature enhances the user experience and facilitates book recommendations based on user preferences.

5. General Administrator Approval: School administrators must receive approval from the general administrators before gaining access to the system. The general administrator accounts, georgemystriotis and anastasialiva, are provided below for demo purposes:

   - Username: georgemystriotis
   - Password: hello

   - Username: anastasialiva
   - Password: there

   Please note that these credentials are for demonstration purposes only and should be modified for actual deployment to ensure security.
